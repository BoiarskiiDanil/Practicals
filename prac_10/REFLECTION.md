# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

Around 70%. Unfortunately, there is not much time until the final exam, which will demand solutions from lectures.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

At least an hour 2 days in a week: during or after n online lecture and once on weekends just before the lessons.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Following PEP 8 standards, which is essential for writing readable and maintainable code. Continuing to adhere to these standards will benefit my learning in both individual and collaborative projects.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop submitting practicals after the deadline, which may also be relevant for assignment tasks.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Despite the diligence for accessible code, sometimes I cannot notice little details that are crucial to code's proper execution, that's why I have to waste time looking for a problem's solution in the lectures or in other online resources such as forums or YouTube videos. Besides, I don't leave comments on my code very often that's why sometimes a chunk of code looks like either redundant or out of place. Also, in addition to that, submitting practicals in time is the worst aspect of my learning right now and I understand that it hinders my progress a lot.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Effectively applying theoretical concepts in my practicals, such as using inheritance or composition in class design. This shows understanding of how to translate theory into practice and applying it when needed.
