# Practical 07 - Classes 2

## Code reviews help you learn!

Remember to do this prac (as usual now) in a **new branch**, then do a **pull request**, mentioning
the correct student to get a code review.  
Remember to check and do your code review when requested.

[Find the right student to mention here each week (different for each practical)](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Code-Review-Order#prac-6)

Let's run through the process again:

- Ensure that your `master` branch is up-to-date: **Merge** your PR on GitHub. This updates your `master` branch to
  contain the work from your last feedback branch.
- Locally, in PyCharm, **Checkout** your `master` branch.
- **Pull** to update your local `master` branch. This pulls in the changes from GitHub including the merge.
- (Double-check that you are on the `master` branch, not the feedback branch.)
- Create a new branch, `prac_07_feedback`.

Expectations and marking for this prac include **doing a code review** not just requesting one.  
Submit both your own PR URL where you **request** a review, and the PR URL of the code review you have done.  
We understand that this means someone else must have requested that you do a review.
